# DoIHaveIt

This project is for Dev Chat's hackathon. Unfortunately this project was unable to be completed but alot of the frontend and styling is complete.

## Purpose

The main reason I wanted to make this app is undoubtedly for the circumstances we're all in. In the early days of the pandemic (which doesn't seem far) there was alot of uncertainty around how to get tested. I wanted to gather the definite questions medical professionals were asking to determine if you needed to get tested. Ultimately this app would ask those same questions, find out if you need to get actually tested and point you to your nearest test center.

## Blockers

I am new to Angular and Typescript and this posed a blocker when attempting to retrieve the values from the selected radio buttons. I was unable to create a reactive form and get the values. I also tried using ngmodel or template reference variables but could not pass down the html element values to the proper component. I wanted to get the values from the selected radio buttons and based on these values have some logic to show if you had the virus or not.

## Tools

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.

### Future Development

- Google Maps API for actual testing centers.
- Twilio API for contacting friends and family to quarantine themselves if you have the virus.

### Thanks for checking my app out!
